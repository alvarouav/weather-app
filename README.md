# 🌤️ Technical Task Overview

## 🧩 Technologies Chosen

**Frontend:**  
React, with a simple application and a single component responsible for displaying the average temperature.

**Backend:**  
Node.js, applying Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with Express for simplicity and speed in this small-scale implementation.  
I focused primarily on backend, as this aligns with my expertise and the requirements of the role.

## 🧠 Why DDD

The DDD-based architecture aligns with the company’s goals of building scalable, maintainable systems with clear technical vision.

### Key benefits of this approach include:

- **Scalability & maintainability:** separation of concerns allows the system to grow with minimal coupling.  
- **Business-aligned technical vision:** a common language improves communication across teams.  
- **Modern engineering practices:** facilitates CI/CD, automated testing, and cloud deployment (e.g., AWS).  
- **Clean, testable, and adaptable code:** structured to evolve without compromising system coherence.

This approach demonstrates my backend expertise, clean architecture mindset, and readiness to build complex, scalable systems, while providing a foundation that can easily evolve as part of a larger weather data integration epic.


## ⚡ Features

Possible features to implement or extend in the system:

- **Logging system (Logger):** Centralized logging of events and errors.  
- **Input validation with schemas (e.g., ZOD):** Ensures incoming data meets expected rules.  
- **Error handler for controllers:** Centralizes error handling and provides consistent API responses.
- **Integration with external repositories:** Connect additional services such as databases, third-party APIs, etc.
